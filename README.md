**Title:**

**Abstract:**

**Research questions:**
How has the role of women in the film industry evolved over the years?
What is the current state of women's representation in the film industry?
Are women poised to play a more significant role in the future of the film industry?

**Proposed additional datasets:**
1. IMDB Ratings
  This dataset was chosen to incorporate the ratings films received, which will be linked to revenue data (already available in the CMU movies database) to create a variable
  measuring a filmâ€™s success.

3. Bechdel Test Results
  This dataset contains Bechdel test scores, which provide insight into the interactions between women in films. By integrating these scores with other variables from the CMU movies dataset,
  we can analyze correlations between the Bechdel test results and other factors like ratings, revenue, and genre.

**Methods:**
To explore the relationship between Bechdel test scores and other variables in the dataset, we primarily conducted linear regression analyses to identify potential patterns. 
The next step involves performing propensity score matching to determine which variables act as confounders in these relationships.

For Part 3, we plan to apply techniques from the "Handling Text Data" lectures. This will involve analyzing movie summaries to identify lexical fields associated with higher 
or lower Bechdel test scores, uncovering the language patterns linked to gender representation.
