**Abstract:**

We begin by examining the general position of women in cinema, analyzing historical and contemporary trends in female representation. This foundational analysis highlights the disparities and progress in the industry, setting the stage for deeper exploration. Through tools like the Bechdel Test and trend analysis, we will evaluate the depth and importance of female roles across genres and decades, offering insights into the broader cultural implications of gender in film. 
Building on these insights, we will conduct a comprehensive data analysis to identify the optimal characteristics of a female lead—such as age, height, ethnicity, and character type—that contribute to a movie's success in terms of box office revenue and critical acclaim. Taking these factors into account, we aim to craft recommendations that not only maximize film success but also achieve a Bechdel Test score of 3. By the end of the project, our goal is to determine how incorporating certain types of female characters can elevate both the commercial and narrative quality of films, while promoting gender inclusivity.
This research sheds light on the gender dynamics within the film industry and provides practical recommendations for casting and storytelling that resonate with audiences and contribute to a more inclusive cinematic future.

**Research questions:**
1. What are the historical and contemporary trends in female representation across various genres and decades?
2. How do the roles assigned to female characters compare to male characters in terms of narrative importance and screen time?
3. How does the Bechdel Test score evolve over time, and what factors contribute to films achieving higher scores?
4. Are female characters increasingly portrayed in roles that go beyond traditional stereotypes, and how does this affect audience reception?
5. What are the optimal attributes (age, height, ethnicity, character type) of a female lead to maximize box office revenue and critical ratings?
6. What is the correlation between achieving a Bechdel Test score of 3 and the financial and critical success of a film?
How has the role of women in the film industry evolved over the years?
What is the current state of women's representation in the film industry?
Are women poised to play a more significant role in the future of the film industry?

**Proposed additional datasets:**
1. IMDB Ratings
  This dataset was chosen to incorporate the ratings films received, which will be linked to revenue data (already available in the CMU movies database) to create a variable
  measuring a film’s success.

3. Bechdel Test Results
  This dataset contains Bechdel test scores, which provide insight into the interactions between women in films. By integrating these scores with other variables from the CMU movies dataset,
  we can analyze correlations between the Bechdel test results and other factors like ratings, revenue, and genre.

**Methods:**
To explore the relationship between Bechdel test scores and other variables in the dataset, we primarily conducted linear regression analyses to identify potential patterns. 
The next step involves performing propensity score matching to determine which variables act as confounders in these relationships.

For Part 3, we plan to apply techniques from the "Handling Text Data" lectures. This will involve analyzing movie summaries to identify lexical fields associated with higher 
or lower Bechdel test scores, uncovering the language patterns linked to gender representation.

- **Data collection:** Gather data on movies, including box office revenue, critical ratings, budgets, genres, release years, and attributes of lead actors (age, height, ethnicity, character type). Collect Bechdel Test scores for films across different time periods and genres to evaluate the depth of female representation.
- **Trend analysis:** Perform descriptive analysis to understand general trends in female representation across genres and decades. Analyze correlations between Bechdel Test scores, box office revenue, critical ratings, and other success metrics.
- **Regression analysis:** Build a predictive model to map actor attributes (age, height, ethnicity, character type) and film characteristics (budget, genre, release year) to success metrics like revenue and ratings.
- **Bechdel test analysis:** Evaluate the progression of female representation quality based on the depth of on-screen interactions.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Examine male and female representation in similar roles to uncover hidden disparities.
